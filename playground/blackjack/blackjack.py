Milestone Project 2 - Blackjack Game simplified version

In this milestone project you will be creating a Complete BlackJack Card Game in Python.

Here are the requirements:

- You need to create a simple text-based BlackJack game
- The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
- The player can stand or hit.
- The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
- You need to keep track of the player's total money.
- You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...

To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:

- Create a deck of 52 cards
- Shuffle the deck
- Ask the Player for their bet
- Make sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips
- Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player
- Show only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden
- Show both of the Player's cards
- Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card
- If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.
- If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17
- Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly
- Ask the Player if they'd like to play again

special rules

- Face cards (Jack, Queen, Kind) count as a value of 10
- Aces can count as either 1 or 11 whichever value is preferable to the player
